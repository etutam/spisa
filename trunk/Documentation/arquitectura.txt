Using multiple panes for one activity. If multiple windows or panes are used in
a particular user activity, it is important to keep them synchronized. In a Web
application, a user interface usually displays a set of elements in a same page
(which may include frames) for a given user activity. However, in rich client
applications, you may actually have many non-modal windows affecting just
one particular process. For example, you may have a product category selector
window floating in your application that lets you specify a particular category,
the products in which will be displayed in another window.
User process components help you to implement this kind of user interface by
centralizing the state for all windows in a single location. You can further simplify
synchronization across multiple user interface elements by using data
bindable formats for state data.
